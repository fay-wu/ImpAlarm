Won Second Place overall hack

Hello! Thanks for your interest in our code for Imp Alarm! This was our first hardware hack project, and we had a ton of fun trying everything out. 

The Materials:
Electric Imp (provided by Electric Imp)
   Electric Imp Blinkup Android phone application
   Electric Imp IDE online
A wristwatch band and mount (provided by SparkFun Electronics)
Stickers for tape (provided by PearlHacks)
WiFi (no browser sign-in page required - this is especially important as the Blinkup application will NOT work if your WiFi requires a sign-in pop-up page, such as those through many universities) (provided by Electric Imp)
Tom's mentorship (from Electric Imp)
24 hours of Gloria and Fay's sweat and labor!
